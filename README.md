put it on your raspberry pi in a 3D printed rpi death star case, 3D printed with tranparent PLA and your rpi lights up on a imperial march tempo!

Launch this script with 'sudo python imperial_march.py' or within a cronjob, and it will light with a different set of colors each time!!



the result is just fun!

PS : did not use randint starting from 0, but from 10, this to prevent some dark colors (quick&dirty, I know)
